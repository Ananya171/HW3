DIALOG: The dialog.py file is used to extract all the dialog into a separate output file, given  a list of input files similar to the sample files(sh.txt and dracula.txt).
The output file generated contains all the dialogs accompanied by the quotation marks.
Input files:<name of the text file>
Output files:Dialog_<name of the input>

DIALOG SEARCH: The dialog_search.py is used to determine if a given search string appears within dialog in the
sample file, on taking an input file similar to the sample files (not previously
known). If yes, the output Chapter number/title is given as the output where the string has been observed.
Input files: <name of the text file>
Output is shown in the CLI.
  
Both programs can be run, in the CLI using "python3 dialog.py" and "python3 dialog_search.py"
